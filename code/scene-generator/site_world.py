"""The Endress+Hauser block as a small 3D world for the app's spot view.

Reads the OpenStreetMap extract and writes the buildings, streets, car parks and
street trees, bushes, lamps and parked cars within RADIUS metres of the block as local metres (x east, y north
of ORIGIN) into a script the spot view loads. The view extrudes them in three.js,
flies down from above the block and lands in front of the chosen bike spot.
No Blender needed.
