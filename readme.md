# Easy+Hitch: Find my Bike Slot

Our entry for **Find my Bike Slot**, the Endress+Hauser challenge at BaselHack
2026. The [challenge brief](documentation/challenge.md) describes the problem,
the suggested features, the available resources and the privacy rules.

Easy+Hitch shows riders which bike slots are free at the Endress+Hauser site
in Reinach before they arrive. Cameras pixelate faces and send a frame only
when their view changes. A serverless backend on AWS reads every
changed slot with Jev 1.14 and keeps only the current state of each slot,
never the images. Riders see the free slots in the iOS app, with a map,
cycling directions and a 3D view of every shelter, and AI agents get the same
answers through an MCP server.

## How it works

1. A camera compares each frame with the last one it sent. Nothing leaves the
   camera until the view changes, or five minutes pass.
2. The camera finds people, pixelates their faces, and uploads the JPEG to the
   Ingest API.
3. The backend fingerprints every slot and asks Jev one yes or no question per
   changed slot. A state changes on a sure answer, or on two unsure answers
   that agree.
4. The Availability API and the MCP server answer from the current slot
   states, and a slot no camera saw for 10 minutes reads `unknown`.

## Run it

Python 3.13 is all it needs locally: no AWS account, no API key, no camera.

```bash
cd code/backend && python3.13 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt && .venv/bin/uvicorn local:app --port 8000
```

In a second terminal, start the recorded cameras, which replay the hosts'
photos of both stations:

```bash
cd code/edge && python3.13 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt && .venv/bin/python main.py --source ../../assets/camera-frames --pii sidecar --upload http --url http://localhost:8000 --tokens dev-tokens.json
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/v1/stations`, or let an AI agent such as
Claude Code ask where to park:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http easy-hitch http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Deploying to AWS, reading slots with Jev and connecting a live camera are
described in the [backend](code/backend/README.md) and
[edge](code/edge/README.md) READMEs.
