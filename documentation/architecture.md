# Architecture: parts and seams

Easy+Hitch is split into parts that are built and changed independently: the
camera pipeline, the backend, the iOS app and the 3D scenes. Each part talks
to the next through one small, written-down interface. The
[architecture diagram](diagrams/easy-hitch-architecture.html) and
[frame flow](diagrams/easy-hitch-flow.html) draw it.

One frame takes this path:

1. A camera captures a frame and compares it with the last frame the backend
   accepted. Nothing happens until the view changes, or five minutes pass.
2. The camera finds people and licence plates, pixelates faces and plates, and
   uploads the JPEG with the person boxes to `POST /v1/frames`.
3. The Ingest function fingerprints every slot and asks Jev 1.14 about the
   slots that changed, one yes or no question per slot crop.
4. The state rule turns the readings into slot states, which DynamoDB keeps.
   The frame is discarded.
5. The Availability function serves the states at `/v1/stations` and, for AI
   agents, through the MCP server at `/mcp`.

| Part | Folder | Interface it owns |
|---|---|---|
| Camera pipeline | `code/edge` | The Ingest API request: JPEG, token, person boxes |
| Backend | `code/backend` | Both API contracts, `OccupancyClassifier`, `OccupancyRepository`, `FingerprintStore` |
| iOS app | `code/ios` | `AreaService`, with a backend client and built-in sample data |
| 3D scenes | `code/scene-generator` | Shelter models with one node per slot |

## Camera and backend: the Ingest API

The camera pipeline sends a frame only when it changed, or every five minutes
as a heartbeat ([`EdgePipeline`](../code/edge/pipeline.py#L26-L53)). It
first pixelates the faces and the readable text it finds, licence plates
among it, or in recorded frames the regions their sidecars list
([`pixelate`](../code/edge/pixelate.py#L12-L22)). It
sends the person boxes along, so the backend skips the slots behind people. The contract is
[`ingest.openapi.json`](api/ingest.openapi.json). The camera's bearer token
names the camera, and the camera's calibration names its station.

The same interfaces serve a live camera and recorded frames:

| Interface | With a camera | With recorded frames |
|---|---|---|
| [`FrameSource`](../code/edge/sources.py#L14-L15) | `WebcamFrameSource` | [`FolderFrameSource`](../code/edge/sources.py#L18-L45) |
| [`PIIDetector`](../code/edge/pii.py#L27-L28) | [`YoloPIIDetector`](../code/edge/pii.py#L57-L69) for faces and [`TextPIIDetector`](../code/edge/text.py#L32-L52) for plates, merged by [`CombinedPIIDetector`](../code/edge/pii.py#L72-L81) | [`SidecarPIIDetector`](../code/edge/pii.py#L36-L54) |
| [`FrameUploader`](../code/edge/upload.py#L17-L19) | [`IngestClient`](../code/edge/upload.py#L22-L58) | [`DryRunUploader`](../code/edge/upload.py#L61-L67) |

## Backend and classifiers: `OccupancyClassifier`

A classifier gets the whole frame and the slots to read, and returns a reading
per slot number ([`OccupancyClassifier`](../code/backend/classification/classifier.py#L27-L28)).
How it looks at the frame is its own strategy:

- [`JevCropClassifier`](../code/backend/classification/jev.py#L34-L64) crops
  every slot and asks Jev 1.14, through OpenRouter's Decisions API, one yes or
  no question per crop, all in one request.
- [`StaticClassifier`](../code/backend/classification/static.py#L25-L57)
  answers from `data/static-readings.json` and needs no network access.

A new classifier is a class with `classify(frame, slots)`, picked in
[`classifier`](../code/backend/composition.py#L84-L98).

## State: `OccupancyRepository` and `FingerprintStore`

- [`OccupancyRepository`](../code/backend/occupancy/repository.py#L15-L21)
  keeps one `StationOccupancy` per station: each slot's state, confidence and
  report times. It holds no images and nothing about people. A save names the
  version it read, so two writers cannot overwrite each other.
- [`FingerprintStore`](../code/backend/ingest/fingerprints.py#L11-L14) keeps
  each camera's slot fingerprints, so unchanged slots skip the classifier.

Both have an in-memory version for a laptop and a DynamoDB version for AWS.
Only [`composition.py`](../code/backend/composition.py) picks implementations.

## Backend and clients: the Availability API and MCP

[`AvailabilityService`](../code/backend/availability/service.py#L33-L70)
answers both the HTTP API ([`availability.openapi.json`](api/availability.openapi.json))
and the MCP server's tools
([`build_server`](../code/backend/availability/mcp_server.py#L31-L58)), with
the same response shapes ([`views.py`](../code/backend/availability/views.py)).
Fields are snake_case in JSON, and station responses carry an `ETag` for
cheap polling.

## iOS app

The app shows the site map with a pin per station, a card with the free count
and cycling directions, and a 3D view with a bike on every taken slot. It
ships sample spots in `code/ios/BikeSlot/Demo/demo-areas.json`, and in demo
mode a random slot changes every four seconds, so the interface can be shown
and developed without a backend. Turn it on with the **Demo data** switch in
the app's settings, or launch with `-demoMode YES` (in Xcode, as an argument
of the scheme's Run action). The backend client and the demo both implement
[`AreaService`](../code/ios/BikeSlot/APIClient.swift#L5-L8), and
`Backend.current` picks one.

## 3D scenes and station models

The Availability API serves `data/models/<station_id>.usdz`. A station model
has one node per slot, named `slot_<number>`, so the app can place a bike on
every taken slot and match it with the slot states. The scene generator in
`code/scene-generator` builds shelter models from layout files in Blender.
